Atomic Swap Contract for Soroban
What Does It Do?
Enables two parties to swap tokens in a trustless, atomic way.

Both users must deposit their tokens before the swap can execute.

The swap can only be completed if both parties have deposited; otherwise, either party can cancel and reclaim their deposit.

How It Works 
create_swap:
Party A creates a swap offer, specifying Party B, the two token addresses, and the amounts to be swapped.

deposit:
Each party must deposit their respective tokens. The contract tracks whether each party has deposited.

complete_swap:
Once both parties have deposited, anyone can call this function to atomically transfer the tokens between the parties (token transfer logic should be implemented with cross-contract calls).

cancel_swap:
If the swap is not completed, either party can cancel it and reclaim their deposit.

view_swap:
Anyone can view the details and status of a swap by its ID.

Notes
Token transfer logic (calling the token contract to actually move tokens) should be implemented in the marked sections using Sorobanâ€™s cross-contract call features.

This contract is for demonstration and should be extended with proper error handling, event logging, and security checks for production use.
